# Numbers Game

## Description

This is an application for tracking the performance of basketball players. The target users for this application are basketball coaches, who 
would like to track their players on MyTeam and get recommendations on scouting adivce that their team can use to prepare for games against 
opponent teams. The current use-case is the NBA, simply because of easy data availability, but future steps for this project would be to 
populate the database with players from multiple different leagues.
